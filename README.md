# cmdEmailer
This is my take on simple program which sends email from command line.

To use it you have to be able to run your python scripts from the cmd.

1.Type cmdEmailer in command line

2.Right after that type email address on which you want to send a message

3.Follow it by topic of the message

4.And lastly type the message itself
